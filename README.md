# Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe

This repository contains a Python implementation of an **Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe** game using the **minimax algorithm** and a simple **GUI** built with **Tkinter**. The game is designed to be unbeatable by the player when playing against the AI, as it utilizes an optimal strategy for both the AI and the human player.

## Key Features

- **Unbeatable AI:** The AI uses the **minimax algorithm** to choose the best move, making it impossible for the player to win if they play optimally.
- **Simple GUI:** The game features a clean and user-friendly graphical interface with buttons for each cell on the board.
- **Human vs. AI:** The game allows a player to play against an AI opponent.
- **Play Again Option:** After a game ends, players can choose to start a new game.
- **Tie Detection:** The game correctly detects ties when there are no more moves to make.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** Launch the game and a window will appear with an empty Tic Tac Toe board.
2. **Make a Move:** Click on an empty cell to place your mark (O). The AI will then make its move (X).
3. **Winning the Game:** The game ends when either player wins, or if all cells are filled resulting in a tie.
4. **Play Again:** After the game ends, you can click the "Play Again" button to start a new game.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually included with Python)

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder and run the script using the following command:
